# react-users-app
 
This is a list of users with a form to add new ones. 
I am using a free fake API to add user objects into the list (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)

A loading indicator and error messages are added.

Here I am using only the name, email and phone properties among the many options the user objects include. 

In this implementation I've made a reusable API Client as well as a Generic HTTP Service for the calls. 

Thank you!
